      <h3>Trump impeachment: Senate says trial is constitutional and can go ahead</h3>
      <img src="images/videos/video1.jpg" style="float:right;display: inline-block;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
      <p>The US Senate has found that the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is constitutional, allowing full proceedings to begin.
        Mr Trump's defence team argued that he could not face trial after leaving the White House.
        But a 56-44 majority voted in favour of continuing, with a handful of Republicans backing the measure.
        Mr Trump is accused of "inciting insurrection" when Congress was stormed last month.</p>
        <p>Thousands gathered in support of false claims that widespread electoral fraud denied Mr Trump victory in the US presidential election.
        However Mr Trump is almost certain to be acquitted because only six Republican senators voted to move forward with impeachment, well short of the 17 Republicans whose votes would be needed to convict Mr Trump.</p>
        <p>Democrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters.
        "That's a high crime and misdemeanour," Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said of the footage. "If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing."</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the former president argued it was unconstitutional to put a former president through the process at all and accused Democrats of being politically motivated.
          A two-thirds majority is required to convict Mr Trump in the evenly split 100-seat Senate. Tuesday's vote implies loyalty toward the former president in his party remains high enough to avoid a conviction.
          However, if convicted, Mr Trump could be barred from holding office again.</p>
          <p>Proceedings opened with impeachment managers - the Democrats tasked with leading the prosecution - arguing their attempts were legitimate.
            In the 10-minute video used in their presentation, Mr Trump was shown telling his supporters to "fight like hell" before they stormed the US Capitol in violence that resulted in five deaths - including a police officer.</p>

      <h3>Covid-19: Travellers face £1,750 cost for England quarantine hotels</h3>
      <img src="images/videos/video2.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
      <p>Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged £1,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.
        The measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries.
        Those who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to £10,000.
        Meanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels</p>
        <p>People travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights.</p>
        <p>Travellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of £10,000 or up to 10 years in jail.
        It comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine.</p>
        <p>Delivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured.
        The health secretary also confirmed a new "enhanced testing" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process.</p>
        <p>They will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers £210.</p>
        <p>"People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk," the health secretary told MPs.
        Airlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said.</p>
        <p>The penalties include a £1,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a £2,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine.
        Failing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between £5,000 and £10,000.</p>
        <p>Asked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: "We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe."</p>

      <h3>Trump impeachment: The short, medium and long story</h3>
      <img src="images/videos/video4.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
      <p>President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier.</p>
      <p>But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August.
        The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
      <p>The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower alleged the president used "the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were "deeply disturbed" by the call and had acted to "lock down" all details of it.
        As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a "complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript" he said would prove the call had been "totally appropriate".</p>
      <p>But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy.
        The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son.
        Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son.</p>

     <h3>Myanmar coup: Police use force as protesters defy ban</h3>
     <img src="images/videos/video5.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
     <p>Police in Myanmar have fired rubber bullets during a demonstration in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, as thousands defied a ban on protests.
       Water cannon and tear gas have also been used against protesters, and one woman is in hospital with a critical head injury.
       News agencies quoted doctors as saying they had seen wounds from live bullets.
       Protesters are standing against a military coup that removed the elected government last week.</p>
      <p>A ban on large public gatherings and night-time curfews has been instigated in some cities, with military leader Min Aung Hlaing warning that no-one is above the law.
        The demonstrators are demanding the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, along with senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD). She was arrested when the military seized power and declared a year-long state of emergency on 1 February.</p>
      <p>Tuesday was the fourth consecutive day of protests. In the evening, the NLD said its party headquarters in Yangon had been "raided and destroyed" by the military.
        In its first acknowledgement of the protests, Myanmar's state TV said police had also been injured while trying to disperse "aggressive" protesters. It said a police truck was destroyed in the city of Mandalay.</p>
      <p>Yangon resident Nelly, 18, (not her real name), described the scenes outside her house as "total chaos".
        "My biggest fear is our safety, because there are lots of people on the roads protesting but there is also a lot of violence from police officers. We don't know when we'll be shot at or when they will arrest us," she told BBC Outside Source on World Service radio.</p>
      <p>
        Earlier on Tuesday, police began using water cannon against protesters in Nay Pyi Taw - but the crowd refused to retreat.
        "End the military dictatorship," people yelled. Some threw projectiles at police, witnesses said.
        Warning shots were eventually fired into the air, before rubber bullets were fired at protesters.</p>

    <h3>Why are farmers in India protesting?</h3>
    <img src="images/videos/video6.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
    <p>More than half of India's 1.3 billion population work on farms, but agriculture contributes to only about a sixth of the country's gross domestic product.
    Agricultural reforms are needed in the country but the issue is tough to handle.
    Smallholdings, shrinking productivity, the increasing cost of living and lack of modernisation have had a stranglehold on this sector. The government distributes large subsidies to keep things under control.</p>
    <h4>Why are there protests in India?</h4>
    <p>Farmers have been protesting against three farm laws published by the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They want the laws scrapped.
    The protests have mainly been led by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, but now thousands are joining in from other parts of the country, particularly from western Uttar Pradesh.
    The Supreme Court of India has suspended the implementation of the laws and constituted a committee. The executive cannot proceed with the implementation of the laws yet.</p>
    <h4>What will India's new farming rules do?</h4>
    <p>The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act allows farmers to sell their produce outside the Agriculture Produce Markets Committees (APMC). This means traders can purchase from a farmer at a mutually agreed price.</p>
    <p>The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to do contract farming and market their produce freely.</p>
    <p>The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act removes food grains, pulses, edible oils and onion from the essential list and makes it unrestricted for trade except in extraordinary circumstance.</p>
    <h4>What are farmers saying?</h4>
    <p>Farmers say the laws will deregulate crop pricing and eventually get rid of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) that guarantees them an income by setting a uniform price for the crop.
    Most farmers are small-scale and have low annual incomes. They are in no position to take their produce out of their district to trade. It will also add to their expenses.</p>
    <p>They believe in the long run a consortium of private players will develop, leaving them vulnerable to large corporations and market forces.
    The dispute mechanism does not allow them to go to court. Instead, it will be brought before a bureaucrat, who the farmers believe will most likely favour big business. The laws are not supported by sufficient regulation, they argue.</p>

    <h3>Russia expels European diplomats over Navalny protests</h3>
    <img src="images/videos/video7.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
    <p>Russia has expelled three diplomats from Germany, Sweden and Poland for joining protests in support of opposition activist Alexei Navalny, who was jailed earlier this week.

The Russian foreign ministry said the three took part in "illegal demonstrations" on 23 January.</p>
<p>The diplomats' home countries have condemned the expulsions, as have the UK, France and the EU.

Mr Navalny is a vociferous critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>The expulsions were announced just a few hours after EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow.

Hundreds of thousands of people took part in protests in support of Mr Navalny across Russia on 23 and 31 January. Thousands were arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Germany</strong> denounced the expulsion as being "in no way justified" and said it would not "go unanswered" if Russia did not reconsider.</p>
<p><strong>Sweden</strong> said the claim that its diplomat took part in the protest on 23 January was unfounded and said it reserved the right to an appropriate response.</p>
<p><strong>Poland</strong> said the expulsion could lead to the "further deepening of the crisis in bilateral relations".</p>
<p>Mr Borrell, on behalf of <strong>the EU</strong>, said he "strongly condemned this decision and rejected the allegations that they conducted activities incompatible with their status as foreign diplomats".</p>
<p>However, Mr Lavrov said any European sanctions over Mr Navalny's treatment would be illegitimate.
Both Germany and Poland said they had summoned their respective Russian ambassadors to express concern over the expulsions - a move that could possibly lead to tit-for-tat measures and more diplomats being sent home.</p>
<p>Russia could have expelled these European diplomats any day: the pro-Navalny protest they supposedly joined was two weeks ago. But the foreign ministry chose to make the announcement with Josep Borrell in town.

The timing was clearly meant to send a message: you can lecture us on human rights and freedom, but we'll do what we want and really don't care what you think. The ministry even had a prepared riposte to condemnation of the mass arrests of protesters: it handed over a video compilation of police violence in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Sergei Lavrov is an old hand at this. He's been communicating indifference and defiance since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the sanctions that followed. International pressure didn't alter Russia's behaviour there. It's preparing to handle the "Navalny issue" the same way.</p>

    <h3>Clare Smyth: First female British chef with three Michelin stars</h3>
    <img src="images/videos/video8.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
    <p>The day after Clare Smyth won three Michelin stars, becoming the first British woman to do so, she drove to her restaurant, Core, and felt “quite emotional. It’s what I’ve worked for my whole life”, she says. But it was a bittersweet moment.
      On Monday night, when she joined the online ceremony, she was at the restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, with her husband and a couple of her 45-strong team – the rest were on Zoom. They celebrated with champagne and a pizza and were in bed by midnight.</p>
    <p>Instead of triumphantly opening up the next day, Smyth worked on her home delivery menu. She spoke to the Guardian over Zoom at lunchtime – in a normal year, she would have been in the midst of a booked-for-months service.
      Still, she has achieved her dream, and it feels different from the three stars she inherited as head chef at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. “I didn’t earn them myself,” she says. “To open my own restaurant with my own vision and ideas, to take it from that to three stars in just over three years …” She pauses. “We didn’t even get to year three before we ended up in lockdown.”</p>
    <p>Smyth has something of the perfectionist, tunnel-vision focus of an elite athlete and the unstoppable stamina of a goods train, and is completely unpretentious. She describes her signature dish, wryly, as “a potato”, though it is the poshest potato you will ever eat, marinated in butter and seaweed and served with herring and trout roe.</p>
    <p>Her kitchen is famously civil. Earlier in her career she was more shouty, “but I grew out of it pretty quickly because it wasn’t me. I’ve gone very far in the other direction now. The kitchen can be quite stressful and I like peace, quiet, I don’t like people banging things. You want it to be a calm environment so that there are no mistakes and people can communicate properly.”</p>
    <p>The pandemic has been “unbelievably stressful”, she says. “It’s the not knowing. We carry not just the business on our shoulders, but all of our team, and the health and wellbeing of everyone around us.” She didn’t know if Core would survive. “We were scared in the beginning, because we didn’t know what was going to happen. It settled a little bit, and now we’re facing another difficult situation, but we’re trying to find new ways to make sure that we can go some way to paying the rent and some of the overheads.”</p>
    <p>She is confident Core will be OK, but she knows many other restaurants will not. “And that’s tough, because there’s millions of people employed in the hospitality industry, as well as farmers, suppliers, producers – the network is huge.”
      For Smyth, work has been all-consuming. While running Core, which opened in 2017, she also found time to cater for Prince Harry and Meghan’s 2018 wedding. Now lockdown has forced her to step back.</p>
      <p>The restaurant cooked for charities, and she has maintained the weekly training sessions, online, for her close-knit staff. But it has been strange suddenly to have so much time at home. She brushed up her French, walked her dog a lot, and cooked. “I’d never really cooked at home before, so at the beginning I was really excited about it.”</p>
    <p>She challenged herself to see how long she could go without repeating the same meal. Her husband, who works in finance, must have been delighted. “Yeah, but we had to do plenty of running to make up for it,” she laughs.</p>
    <p>“I found it incredibly difficult because I had never not worked, and my job is my life. Then, to not do it any more, you lose a little bit of who you are.”</p>

      <h3>'Their goal is to destroy everyone': Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape</h3>
      <img src="images/videos/video9.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
      <p>The men always wore masks, Tursunay Ziawudun said, even though there was no pandemic then.
        They wore suits, she said, not police uniforms.
        Sometime after midnight, they came to the cells to select the women they wanted and took them down the corridor to a "black room", where there were no surveillance cameras.</p>
      <p>Several nights, Ziawudun said, they took her.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps this is the most unforgettable scar on me forever," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't even want these words to spill from my mouth."</p>
      <p>Tursunay Ziawudun spent nine months inside China's vast and secretive system of internment camps in the Xinjiang region. According to independent estimates, more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the "re-education" of the Uighurs and other minorities.</p>
      <p>Human rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation.
        The policy flows from China's President, Xi Jinping, who visited Xinjiang in 2014 in the wake of a terror attack by Uighur separatists. Shortly after, according to documents leaked to the New York Times, he directed local officials to respond with "absolutely no mercy". The US government said last month that China's actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are "lies and absurd allegations".</p>
      <p>First-hand accounts from inside the internment camps are rare, but several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.
        Tursunay Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US, said women were removed from the cells "every night" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.</p>
      <p>Ziawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she "lived in constant fear of being sent back to China", she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said.</p>

        <h3>Captain Sir Tom Moore: UK must 'mark the memory' of NHS charity fundraiser</h3>
        <img src="images/videos/video10.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
        <p>The memory of Captain Sir Tom Moore is to be marked "properly and appropriately", the government said.
          The 100-year-old, who raised almost £33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday.
          Health secretary Matt Hancock said he had "touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that".</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, dozens of tributes have been left outside the veteran's home in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.
          When announcing his death via a family statement, his daughters Hannah Ingram-Moore and Lucy Teixeira said they "shared laughter and tears" with their father in their final few hours together.</p>
        <p>They said his final year of fundraising had been "nothing short of remarkable".
          He tested positive for Covid-19 last week. His family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he was unable to be vaccinated.</p>
        <h4>'Hearts of the nation'</h4>
        <p>Mr Hancock said Capt Sir Tom had been "a symbol of people's resilience during an incredibly difficult year".
          "When the NHS was under pressure during the first lockdown - he didn't just sit at home, he asked the question 'what can I do to help?'," he said.</p>
        <p>"We should find a way to make sure we mark the memory of Captain Tom and thank him for the contribution he made to the NHS.
          "I will ensure that we mark his contribution properly and appropriately at the right moment.
          "I think everybody would welcome that... he touched the hearts of the nation and we should remember that.</p>
        <p>There was a one-minute silence in the House of Commons in honour of Capt Sir Tom, and all victims of the pandemic, ahead of Prime Minister's Questions.
          Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced there would be a national clap for Capt Sir Tom and "all those health workers for whom he raised money" at 18:00 GMT.
          Asked by a newspaper journalist later if he supported calls for a statue of Captain Sir Tom, the prime minister said the idea was "an excellent one".</p>
        <p>"We will be working with his family to see what they think is most appropriate," he added.
          The Army veteran won the nation's hearts by walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden last spring during the first coronavirus lockdown, raising money for NHS Charities Together.
          The fundraising group said that "when the time is right" it will also "put together a suitable tribute... in honour of everything he did for the NHS and NHS charities".</p>

          <h3>Covid: WHO says 'extremely unlikely' virus leaked from lab in China</h3>
          <img src="images/videos/video3.jpg" style="float:right;max-width:500px; margin:15px;">
          <p>International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China.
            Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was "extremely unlikely" that the virus leaked from a lab in the city of Wuhan.</p>
          <p>He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus.
            The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said.
            The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission.
            Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide.</p>
          <p>Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak.
          Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how.</p>
          <p>Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a "natural reservoir" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan.
          He said identifying the animal pathway remained a "work in progress", but that it was "most likely" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species.
          The experts also said there was "no indication" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019.</p>
          <p>Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan.
          The team called for further investigation into the possibility of "cold chain" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food.
          Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia.</p>
          <p>"We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia," he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan.</p>
          <p>"China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."</p>
          <p>He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains.
          The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities.</p>
